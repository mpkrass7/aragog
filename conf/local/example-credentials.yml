# This is a registry of credentials that can be used as node inputs and/or node outputs.
#
# When defining node inputs in the pipeline, you can reference keys from this yaml to indicate
# that the pipeline should map the credential defined here to the node's input at runtime.
#
# The kedro precedent established for references keys defined in parameters.yml is also
# observed for credentials. When defining your node inputs, use:
# e.g. "params:.credentials.my_key_1", "params:credentials.my_key_2.my_sub_key_2"
